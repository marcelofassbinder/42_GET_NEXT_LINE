# 42_GET_NEXT_LINE ‚Ü©Ô∏è
Reading a line from a fd is way too tedious.

# About
This project is part of the Rank 01 from 42 Common Core and focuses on creating a function that can efficiently read and return lines from a given file or other input source.The `get_next_line` function is designed to read a single line (delimited by a newline character) receiving a file descriptor as a parameter. It provides a dynamic and efficient way to process and retrieve lines from various input sources, such as files.
The `get_next_line` function is crafted to read a single line, delimited by a newline character, by accepting a file descriptor as a parameter. It offers a dynamic and efficient solution for processing and retrieving lines from diverse input sources, including files.
# Norminette ü™ñ
At 42 School, we need to follow some strict rules when writing our code. These rules are described in the Norm and checked by the formidable `norminette`. Here are some of them:
```
- No for, do...while, switch, case, goto, ternary operators and variable-length arrays are allowed
- Each function must be maximum 25 lines
- One single variable declaration per line
- You can‚Äôt declare more than 5 variables per function
- You can't write more thane 5 functions per file
...
```
